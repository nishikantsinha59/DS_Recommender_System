A recommender System aimed to recommend topics belonging to a particular course
Nishikant Sinha - February 2018

The recommender system uses the concept of Network analysis with igraph package.

This repository contains code for two diffrent recommender System aimed to recommend topics belonging to a particular course. Their core functionality is same but they only differ in the way they take inputs. One takes input as regular console while other requires input in JSON array or object.

1) recommenderSystem.R - This one contains predifined universal course graph and the user is given control to select the syllabus from available option. After selecting the syllabus user will be asked to give input as pass(1) or fail(0) and based on the result the recommendation will be made.

2) recommenderSystemJSON.R - This system also has a predefined universal course graph but unlike the former system this will prompt user to input JSON array for syllabus having nodes of a particular syllabus. This will also prompt the user to enter Pass/ Fail value for each node as JSON object.
